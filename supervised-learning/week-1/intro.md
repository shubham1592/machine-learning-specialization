## Three major types of Machine Learning
- 1. superwised learning
- - a. some input x -> some output y -> classified label (0/1)
- 2. unsupervised learning
- - a. clustering -> given some data, make similar clusters
- - b. anomaly detection -> identify something abnormal
- - c. dimensionality reduction -> compress datasets without loosing information
