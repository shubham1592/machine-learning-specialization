## Four Major Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Learns from labeled data â€” input \( x \) maps to output \( y \).

- **Example:** Classifying emails as spam (1) or not spam (0).

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Finds patterns in unlabeled data.

- **Clustering:** Groups similar items (e.g., customer segmentation).
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flags outliers (e.g., fraud detection).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Compresses data while preserving key features (e.g., PCA).

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learns by interacting with an environment to maximize rewards.

- **Example:** Training a game-playing agent through trial and error.

### 4. Recommender Systems
Suggests items based on user behavior and preferences. Uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrids.

- **Example:** Netflix recommending movies based on what you've watched.
